        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) carton sour cream</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups fresh blueberries</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup salted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) box powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice, or more as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place 24 paper baking cups in two (12-cup) muffin pans. Set aside. </li>
        <li>Beat butter and cream cheese with a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment at medium speed until creamy, about 1 minute. Gradually add sugar and beat until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating just until blended after each addition. Beat in vanilla, lemon juice, and lemon zest.</li>
        <li>Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture alternately with sour cream on low speed, beating just until blended after each addition, beginning and ending with flour mixture. Gently fold in blueberries. Spoon or scoop batter into prepared baking cups, filling each about 2/3 full (about 1/4 cup batter for each).</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a wooden pick inserted in the centers comes out clean, 22 to 25 minutes. Cool in pans on wire racks for 5 minutes. Remove from pans to wire racks and cool completely, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>For the frosting beat cream cheese and butter with a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment at medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Reduce speed to low and gradually add powdered sugar and beat well. Beat in zest and 1 teaspoon lemon juice. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy, adding 1 teaspoon lemon juice if needed to reach desired consistency. Pipe or spread frosting onto cupcakes.</li>
    </ol>
